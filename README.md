#Overwatch Text-based Fight Simulator
My second web project that consists of creating a web application (with an API) around the theme of Overwatch2.

## Start
You need to have npm installed.
Install packages with 'npm install'.
to launch this application you need to place yourself inside this folder and type 'npm run serve'.
The database used will be the same as for my server.
